            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Alexandica is a nation found on the continent of Eclinos. It is a fledgling country, founded only around 200 years
                ago by Alexander of the Dia Tribe, which later became the Diamantis royal family, after he united the tribes of
                the area against the Sporan Raids.

            <h2>The Creation of Alexandica</h2>
            <p>
                The Alexandica region used to be home of dozens of individual tribes that lived in relative harmony. 
                That is before the Sporan Raids, from the Lands of Ruin, brought destruction and instability to the region. 
                That was when one human from the Dia tribe known as Alexander sought out to unite the tribes and repel the Ruin 
                from their lands. It was a long and arduous process but he was successful, fully uniting the tribes and getting rid of the 
                Sporans. In case of another conflict, Alexander proposed that all tribes should unite into one tribe nation to 
                make sure they are prepared for any other attack that might come, which all tribes unanimously agreed upon. 
                They then called this new nation “Alexandica”, in respect of the man who united all the tribes 
                against the Ruin of Spora.

            <h2>Recent History</h2>
            <p>
                Alexandica has been growing at a steady pace over the 200 years since its founding. It has recently reached its
                Iron Age, and has steadily been phasing out the use of bronze. It is currently ruled by Basileus Argyros Diamantis. A
                very young, and ambitious ruler who wishes to expand Alexandica's boundries, as well as redeem his family's name after
                his father disgraced it via his more tyranncial rule.
